## About/TDLR
Data professionals are always changing and with recent growths in jobs, we wanted to see trends.
We used data from StackOverflow and AI-salaries.net for our analysis as proxies, and then we normalized salaries using PPP to make as accurate comparisons as possible.
We find certain countries are more susceptible to changes, mainly Argentina and Russia such that they have staggering percentage changes due to explainable economic reasons.
